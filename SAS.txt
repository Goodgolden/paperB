The function of a REPLICATE statement is related to but not quite the same as 
the function of either a FREQ or a WEIGHT statement in 
other statistical modeling procedures, such as the GLM, GENMOD, GLIMMIX, and 
LOGISTIC procedures. A FREQ or a WEIGHT value essentially multiplies the log likelihood
or sum of squares contribution for each observation. 
On the other hand, a REPLICATE value multiplies the log likelihood contribution
of each subject, which consists of one or more observations.
